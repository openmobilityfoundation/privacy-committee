# Welcome to the Privacy, Security, and Transparency Committee

We are an [Open Mobility Foundation](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/) committee tasked with advising the Foundation on principles and practices that ensure the secure handling of mobility data. 

To that end, we seek to bring together our members and engage subject matter experts so that we can develop these practices openly and collaboratively. Although voting membership in the committee is limited to OMF member organizations, we invite and encourage participation from anyone.

## Current Work

The Privacy, Security and Transparency committee will review and develop policy for appropriate transparency and data protection measures such as privacy, data retention and anonymization features, as well as technical security practices related to urban mobility data including but not limited to encryption, role-based access control, and penetration testing.  These policies shall support responsible and trustworthy data management practices that serve individual privacy, security, transparency and safety.

Our work thus far focuses on these deliverables:

1. [Inventory of the State of Practice](/products/state-of-the-practice.md) [Complete and Ongoing]

   - We built a catalog of current principles, policies, methods, and technologies applicable to location data privacy and anonymization.

2. [MDS Privacy Guide for Cities](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/governance/blob/main/documents/OMF-MDS-Privacy-Guide-for-Cities.pdf) [Complete and Ongoing]

   - The MDS Privacy Guide is intended to help cities responsibly adopt MDS by laying out the considerations and best practices related to MDS data and personal privacy. It was authored by the voting membership of the OMF's Privacy, Security, and Transparency Committee and was approved by the OMF Board of Directors on 2020-09-15, revised for MDS 2.0 on 2023-03-17.

3. [CDS Privacy Guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nujWaj1ScxQ-1I9_BGrMKZ_mV_8mbk8tG_C21CQO7Cw/edit?usp=sharing) [Complete and Ongoing]

   - Helps equip cities with the support and resources they need to implement CDS, and keep the information they handle safe and secure. This guide identifies relevant data in CDS, use cases, and provides suggestions on the safe handling of this data. 

4. [Privacy Principles for Mobility Data](http://mobilitydataprivacyprinciples.org) [Complete]

   - Working with NABSA and NUMO, we developed a set of principles to guide organizations working with mobility data to protect individual pivacy. These principles were released in October 2021 and have been formally endorsed by the OMF.

5. [Using MDS Under GDPR](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/using-mds-under-gdpr/) [Complete and Ongoing]

   - Guidance and Q&A for cities and companies using MDS under the European GDPR framework.

6. [Use Case Database](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/whats-possible-with-mds/) [Complete and Ongoing]

   - Dynamic database of MDS use cases to illustrate the specific ways in which cities are using MDS to create policy, enforce rules, manage hundreds of devices, and ensure the safe operation of vehicles in the public right of way. See the use case [blog post](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/use-cases-how-why-cities-use-mds/).
